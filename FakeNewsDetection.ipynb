      "In an unprecedented discovery that challenges everything we know about the solar system, scientists from the International Space Agency (ISA) have confirmed that the moon is, in fact, made entirely of cheese. The groundbreaking finding was announced early this morning following a decade-long investigation involving lunar samples, remote sensing technologies, and taste tests by renowned cheese experts. The ISA's lead scientist, Dr. Gouda Brie, stated in a press conference, \"After extensive analysis, we can conclusively say the moon's composition is predominantly cheddar, with a solid core of aged parmesan. This not only rewrites our understanding of lunar geology but also opens up new possibilities for the dairy industry.\" The discovery was made possible by the latest mission, CheeseRover-1, which landed on the moon's surface last year and conducted the first-ever direct sampling of the lunar surface. The rover was equipped with advanced spectrometers, capable of identifying complex organic compounds, and a state-of-the-art cheese knife. World leaders have hailed the discovery as a monumental leap in space exploration, with plans already underway to establish the first lunar dairy farm. Meanwhile, space agencies worldwide are revising their astronaut training programs to include cheese-making skills. In related news, the price of moon-themed cheese boards has skyrocketed, with enthusiasts eager to get a taste of the cosmos. Despite the excitement, scientists caution that it may take years before lunar cheese is available for public consumption. Experts are now speculating on the implications of this discovery for the existence of wine lakes on Mars, suggesting that the universe might be far more delicious than previously thought.\n",

      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 12 said his government undertakes developmental works as a part of its mission to build the nation and not to win elections as perceived by some people.  The PM launched ₹1,06,000 crore development projects for the country at an event in Sabarmati area of Gujarat’s Ahmedabad city after visiting the Dedicated Freight Corridor’s (DFC) Operation Control Centre near the venue, ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.  These comprise ₹85,000 crore railway projects, including the launch of 10 new Vande Bharat trains, and a petrochemicals complex coming up at Dahej in Gujarat’s Bharuch district with an investment of ₹20,600 crore.  “Some people try to look at our efforts through the electoral lens. Let me tell you that we undertake developmental works as part of a mission to build the nation, not to form a government (by winning elections). We want to ensure that our youth do not suffer what their past generations had suffered. This is Modi’s guarantee,” the PM said.  Also Read | PM Modi inaugurates Mahatma Gandhi Sabarmati Ashram redevelopment project worth ₹1,200 crore  The PM said that in the last 10 years, his government spent around six times more amount for the development of railways than was done earlier.  “In just over two months of 2024, we have inaugurated and laid the foundation of ₹11 lakh crore projects,” he said.  “I started my life on railway tracks, so I know how bad our railways were earlier,” he said.  Mr. Modi said he discontinued the separate railway budget and included it in the Union Budget so that government money can be used for the development of Railways.  PM Modi flags off 10 new Vande Bharat trains PM Modi said his government has shown a strong willpower to pull the Railways out of a “hell-like situation” and this sector’s development is among their topmost priorities.  The previous governments did not give priority to the doubling of railway tracks, he said.  Referring to the DFC, he said that for decades, there was a demand of separate tracks for goods trains.  It would have increased the speed of both passenger and goods trains and was also necessary to boost agriculture, trade and export activities, he said.  “But under the Congress regime, this project was either delayed or hit roadblocks. Today, we are inaugurating the freight corridor having a length of 650 km,’‘ said the PM.  The PM also said that till now, 350 ‘Aastha’ trains have facilitated 4.5 lakh people to visit Ayodhya.  He laid the foundation stone of railway workshops, loco sheds, pit lines/ coaching depots, the Phaltan-Baramati new line; electric traction system upgradation work and dedicated to the nation two new sections of the Dedicated Freight Corridor between New Khurja to Sahnewal (401 Rkm) section of the eastern DFC and New Makarpura to New Gholvad section (244 Rkm) of the western DFC; western DFC's Operation Control Centre (OCC), Ahmedabad.  The PM flagged off 10 new Vande Bharat trains between Ahmedabad-Mumbai Central, Secunderabad-Visakhapatnam, Mysuru-Dr MGR Central (Chennai), Patna- Lucknow, New Jalpaiguri-Patna, Puri-Visakhapatnam, Lucknow-Dehradun, Kalaburagi-Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal Bengaluru, Ranchi-Varanasi and Khajuraho- Delhi (Nizamuddin).  He also flagged off the extension of four Vande Bharat trains.  The Ahmedabad-Jamnagar Vande Bharat train is being extended till Dwarka, Ajmer-Delhi Sarai Rohilla Vande Bharat till Chandigarh, Gorakhpur-Lucknow Vande Bharat till Prayagraj and Thiruvananthapuram-Kasargod Vande Bharat till Mangaluru.  The PM also flagged off two new passenger trains between Asansol and Hatia & Tirupati and Kollam stations.  Mr. Modi also flagged off freight trains on the DFC from various locations — New Khurja Junction, Sahnewal, New Rewari, New Kishangarh, New Gholvad, and New Makarpura.  He dedicated 50 Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras at various railway stations. These centres will offer affordable and quality generic medicines to the people.  The PM also dedicated to the nation 51 Gati Shakti Multi-Modal Cargo Terminals, which will promote seamless movement of goods between different modes of transportation.\n",

It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023;[23][24] and from the time of its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.[25][26][27] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar[k] to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.  Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[28][29][30] Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[31] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[32] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[33][34] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[35] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[36] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[37] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[38] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[39] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[40] but also marked by the declining status of women,[41] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[l][42] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[43]\n",

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump's administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration's request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. 00:05  02:03    A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. \"The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD's study and will continue to defend the president's lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen.

All applicants must meet all accession standards.\" Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal \"great news.\" \"I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,\" Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration.

Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military \"cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\"\n",
